In this demo, either pipe (the second is just an alternative solution) outputs the frequency that each letter of the alphabet occurs in the input text after first being scrubbed of all non-alphabetic chars. Run against the default input text. 

In Linux, to run this demo from a terminal, do the following:

   - Open a terminal.
   - Change to this folder.
   - Run these two shell commands:

     echo "now is the time for all good men" | pcl "call './Letter Freq1.pip'"

     echo "now is the time for all good men" | pcl "call './Letter Freq2.pip'"
