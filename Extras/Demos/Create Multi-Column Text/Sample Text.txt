PipeWrench is a utility that allows you to process text. It functions similarly to how pipes/filters work in Unix, except with a graphical user interface. To use, just enter the pipe commands (one per line) into the Pipe text control at the top of the form, the text you're editing into the Input text control, any pipe arguments into the Arguments text control and click the "Run" button. The results will display in the Output text control. After you've tested your pipe and you're satisfied that it works as intended, you can then click the "Export" button to copy its text to the clipboard as a command line compatible pipe. Likewise, a command line compatible pipe can be copied from a script and imported back into PipeWrench using the "Import" button.
