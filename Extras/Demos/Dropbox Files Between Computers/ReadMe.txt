This folder contains a couple of bash scripts, (files2sync and syncfiles) that can be used to keep the important files on your Linux-based workstation backed up onto a "backup server" on your home network. For an in-depth tutorial that will walk you through the process, see the document, "How to Dropbox Files Between Computers on Your Home Network.pdf" which is located in the "Extras" folder in the PipeWrench repository on GitHub (https://github.com/bblock/PipeWrench).
